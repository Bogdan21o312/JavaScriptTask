// MountainRange ====================================================================================================

/**

 * A mountain range is an array that can be conditionally
 * divided into 2 parts - increasing and decreasing,
 * and at the junction of these two parts there is a peak that we need to find.
 * In the ascending part,
 * the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
 * And in descending order - in descending order.
 * In this case, there may be a situation where the increasing or decreasing part is completely absent.
 * And the highest point (peak) will still be present.
